                <p>No one knows exactly when or how coffee was discovered. While many different legends have circulated, one remains to be the most popular. Many believe that the history of coffee began with a goat farmer, named Kaldi, in Ethiopia during the 9th century. One day Kaldi noticed that some of his herd possessed boundless energy and excitement after grazing on a bright red cherry of the coffee plant. The few goats that obtained the red coffee cherry had so much energy that they failed to fall asleep that night due to how energized they were. Because of this, Kaldi wanted to try the beans for himself to see how his body would react to them. He, as well as the goats, became full of energy and liveliness. The next day Kaldi shared his findings with the local monastery, who then disregarded his anecdotes and threw the beans in the fire. Alas, a notable aroma filled the air and the beans were then picked out of the fire for further investigation. From the investigation, the monks crush the beans and added them to water. The monks soon found that the beverage gave them the same energy and zest as Kaldi and his goats. Thereafter, the monks passed their findings on to the other monks and so began the wild beginning of coffee! </p>

                <p>Coffee began spreading across the Arabian peninsula and the Muslim world, with Yemen being coffee's first destination after leaving Ethipoia. By the end of the 16th century, this beverage had spread to the rest of the Middle East, Persia, and Turkey. Coffee's next destination was India as Sufi Baba Budan smuggled many beans from the Arabs in order to stop the monopoly that was growing. From here, coffee is said to have spread to Europe before being taken by colonizers to their colonies and then spread further across the world. Venice was the first port of call once the coffee landed in Europe. Venice is a port which conducts a huge amount of trade with North Africa and the Middle East. The Dutch and the British began importing large quantities of boffee back to their homeland. Before this, the Arabian peninsula was charging very high prices for their product because of the monopoly they were growing. However, the new imports arriving in Northern Europe helped lower prices and increase the availability. As demand increased, the search for the coffee tree began. The Dutch won the race and started planting these trees in the Amsterdam Botanical Gardens in the early 1600s. The Dutch soon moved their plantations to Indonesia and Suriname and became a major supplier of coffee to Europe.

                <p>Around 600 million people rely on the coffee industry for their everyday needs, which equivalates to around 10% of the world's population. With the popularity of coffee, coffee shops and houses play a crucial role in society and have not only become places to drink coffee but places to socialize and bond with one another. Today coffee shops, around the world, are seen as comfortable settings for meeting friends, working, studying, and first dates. Coffee’s story began in Ethiopia, and its growth is tightly woven with the expansion of Europe’s colonial powers. Coffee is now one of the world's biggest exports and around 10% of the world's population can count themselves as part of the worldwide coffee industry. To believe this all started from a few goats who were energized from some cherries over 1100 years ago is a wild turn of events!
